# API-Automation
Automating API using Java

This project is created to understand and learn the concepts of API Automation.
You will learn to automate a restful API using live examples (openweathermap data)
Register at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and generate your own API key.
We will utilize the restassured library from JayWay to automate the restful APIs.
The data will be converted to JSON, hence knowledge in parsing JSON data is a pre-requisite.
JSONtest file contains a sample JSON request along with most commonly used JSONPath Expression which serves as a ready reckoner.
